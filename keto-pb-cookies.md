## How to Make Keto Peanut Butter Cookies

**Follow these instructions on how to make the best keto peanut butter cookies recipe and you’ll be cooking them all the time as a ready to go low-carb snack.**

1. Preheat your oven to 160C/320F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, add all ingredients and mix together. Be sure to mix all the ingredients thoroughly.
3. Roll the mixture into heaped tablespoon-sized balls and press onto your cookie sheet. These cookies do not spread at all so be sure to shape them into your desired size before baking and press with a fork or your fingers to create crunchy ridges. The ridgier (if that’s a word), the better.
4. Bake in the oven for 12-18 minutes or until the tops of the cookies are browning, and the edges are beginning to harden. They will firm up and get crunchy once cooled.
5. Leave cookies to cool completely before enjoying.
