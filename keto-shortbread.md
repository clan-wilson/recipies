## **Keto Shortbread Cookies Ingredients**

- 2 cups of Almond Flour
- ⅓ cup of Erythritol
- 1 pinch of Salt
- 1 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract
- ½ cup of Unsalted Butter softened
- 1 large Egg

## **How To Make Keto Shortbread Cookies**

1. Preheat oven to 150C/300F.
2. In a mixing bowl, add the almond flour, erythritol, salt and vanilla extract. Mix.
3. Add the butter and rub into the dry ingredients until fully combined.
4. Add the egg and mix well.
5. Take tablespoon sized pieces of the mixture and roll into balls, then press onto a lined cookie sheet. We recommend using [food safe gloves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CYGLO0M?tag=surfdiveandsk-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) to stop the mixture from sticking to your hands.
6. Leave a gap between the cookies as they will spread slightly.
7. Bake for 15-25 minutes, until the edges are browned. The cookies will firm up as they cool. If you are using the cookies as a base for our Jello Chunk Cheesecake, allow them to cook longer so the edges are firm and they are completely browned.
8. Leave to cool before storing in an airtight cookie jar, or if using it as a cheesecake base.
